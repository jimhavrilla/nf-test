A small tutorial repo for nextflow practice with the lab

## Prerequisites

You need Java 8 or higher to run `nextflow`.  Also `bash > 3.2` (pretty easy to meet requirement).

`wget -qO- https://get.nextflow.io | bash` will install nextflow by creating a binary executable you can just move to a folder in your `$PATH`.
